# PRIVACY POLICY
Effective Date: June 27, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how the "Medical Drug Researcher" Dify Plugin (the "Plugin") processes information when you use it within your Dify applications (Chatflows, Workflows, or Agents).

1. Introduction
The Medical Drug Researcher Dify Plugin is designed to retrieve public information regarding drug usage and side effects by integrating with the DrugBank API. This Plugin operates as a bridge, forwarding your requests to the DrugBank API and presenting the retrieved information back to you within Dify.

2. Information We Process
When you use the Plugin, the following information is involved:

Input Data: The only personal data we directly process via the Plugin's input is the drug_name you provide to search for.

API Keys/Endpoints: Your DrugBank API Key and Endpoint URL are securely stored within your Dify environment's plugin credentials. The Plugin accesses these credentials only to authenticate and direct its requests to the DrugBank API.

3. How Information is Used
The drug_name you provide is used solely for the purpose of constructing a query to the DrugBank API to retrieve relevant drug information (usage and side effects). The retrieved information is then returned to your Dify application.

The Plugin itself does not store, log, or retain any of the drug_name inputs or the information retrieved from the DrugBank API beyond the immediate processing of your request.

4. Information Sharing and Disclosure
To fulfill your request, the drug_name you provide will be transmitted to the DrugBank API (a third-party service). By using this Plugin, you acknowledge and agree that your drug_name query will be shared with DrugBank for the purpose of executing the search.

We are not responsible for the privacy practices of DrugBank. We encourage you to review DrugBank's own privacy policy to understand how they collect, use, and share your information.

5. Data Retention
As stated above, the Plugin does not retain any of your input data or retrieved drug information. The processing is real-time and ephemeral. Information retention, if any, for your queries would be governed by DrugBank's data retention policies and Dify's platform policies.

6. Security
We take reasonable measures to protect the Plugin itself from unauthorized access or misuse. However, no internet transmission or electronic storage is 100% secure. While the Plugin handles your API key securely via Dify's credential management, you are responsible for keeping your Dify credentials and DrugBank API key confidential.

7. Your Rights
Since the Plugin does not store your data, direct access, correction, or deletion requests regarding data processed by the Plugin should be directed to the Dify platform (for your interaction history) or to DrugBank (for any data they might retain related to API calls made from your account).

8. Disclaimer: Not Medical Advice
THE MEDICAL DRUG RESEARCHER DIFY PLUGIN IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE MEDICAL ADVICE. IT IS NOT INTENDED TO BE A SUBSTITUTE FOR PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL ADVICE, DIAGNOSIS, OR TREATMENT. ALWAYS SEEK THE ADVICE OF YOUR PHYSICIAN OR OTHER QUALIFIED HEALTH PROVIDER WITH ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE REGARDING A MEDICAL CONDITION OR DRUG USE. NEVER DISREGARD PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL ADVICE OR DELAY IN SEEKING IT BECAUSE OF SOMETHING YOU HAVE READ OR OBTAINED THROUGH THIS PLUGIN.

9. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Plugin's listing or associated documentation within the Dify platform. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

10. Contact Us
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or the Plugin's data practices, please contact the Plugin developer (YourName/YourCompany) through the Dify platform's support channels.Privacy Policy for Medical Drug Researcher Dify Plugin
